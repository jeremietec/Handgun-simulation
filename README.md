THE BREAKDOWN
The barrel has an aggressive target crown and sits flush with the end of the slide and dustcover. An M1911’s slide rides outside of the frame’s rails, and the barrel typically has both a bushing and a swinging link. With a CZ 75, the slide rides inside the frame, and the bushing-¬less barrel locks up with the breech without the use of a link. With the DWX you get a combination of the two. The slide rides outside the rails like an M1911, but it uses a bushing-¬less barrel with a CZ 75-type lockup. The ramped barrel is unique to the DWX, too, and had a flared end to more tightly mate with the slide. The DWX has an external extractor with a spring (like a CZ 75), unlike the internal, tensioned and sometimes finicky extractor design of the M1911.
The top of the slide is flat and serrated. The front sight is steel with a green fiber-optic insert, which is easy to spot in any light. The front sight uses a modern M1911 dovetail. The steel rear sight is basic black and serrated, but there is a click-
adjustable screw on top of the rear sight to allow elevation adjustments. The rear sight is secured in the dovetail by two set screws; loosening them allows the sight to drift in the dovetail for windage corrections. Then, lock it back down. The set screws are a nice feature. Anyone who has spent a lot of time putting rounds downrange through handguns has likely had a rear sight come loose in the dovetail.
This pistol has a single-¬action-¬only (SAO), recoil-operated system. For this pistol to fire, the hammer has to be cocked. If the hammer is down, it won’t. The DWX has a bilateral manual thumb safety with nicely extended levers. With the hammer cocked, the safety can be engage by pushing it up. If you’re going to carry an SAO gun for self-¬defense, you should carry it “cocked and locked,” as they say. Therefore, you can draw and fire it with one hand, in one smooth continuous movement. Even though the DWX has a grip profile closer to that of a CZ 75, the thumb safety appears to have come from a DW1911. Both its position and function feels like a 1911’s, which is great. Unlike a 1911, though, this pistol has no grip safety.
